TX Convergent 2025 Tech Stack:
- Used React Native and Expo go for the frontend
- Used Firebase for backend, to store user data (workouts, key balance) and store information about partners (cost of their key, details)

Our product is an easy to use app that allows users to track their daily workouts and customize it to their needs. After they finish their workout, they earn keys that allow them to obtain discounts on classes, free day passes to gyms, and discounts on local healthy eateries. 

You can use the app yourself using Expo Go, using the command 'npx expo --tunnel'.
